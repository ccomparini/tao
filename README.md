# (yet another copy of) The Tao of Programming 

I copied this from [user xela at MIT](https://www.mit.edu/~xela/tao.html)

The "value added" in this version is of an oracular nature:  you can
ask it to show you a random chapter/verse, or one specially selected
and suited for today's date in your timezone (or according to your
browser's notion of the current time).  For example:

    https://fbmstudios.net/chris/tao/?today   - today's message
    https://fbmstudios.net/chris/tao/?random  - random

Additionally, you can specify a particular chapter/verse to display
via the URL fragment.  For example:

    https://fbmstudios.net/chris/tao/#1.4
